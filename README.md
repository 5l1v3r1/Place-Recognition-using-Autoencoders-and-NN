### Place recognition with WiFi fingerprints using Autoencoders and Neural Networks

Tensorflow implementation of model discussed in the following paper: [Low-effort place recognition with WiFi fingerprints using deep learning] (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1611.02049v1.pdf)

### Tools Required

Python 2.7 is used during development and following libraries are required to run the code provided in the notebook:
* Tensorflow
* Numpy
* Pandas

### Dataset

The UJIIndoorLoc dataset used for model training and testing, can be downloaded from the following [[link]] (
